This Python script is designed for statistical analysis, likely related to Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) or purchase behavior data. The key functionalities of the script include:

Dataset Handling:

The script imports and reads data using pandas.
It appears to work with a dataset stored in an Excel file, with placeholders for the dataset path.
ANOVA Test:

Performs a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) using scipy.stats.f_oneway to compare the means of different groups (e.g., conditions like "Purchase Likelihood" across multiple groups).
Statistical Analysis:

The script extracts unique conditions from a column named 'Condition1' and performs statistical tests to analyze the relationship between these conditions and another variable (likely tied to purchasing behavior).
Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation.
scipy.stats: For statistical analysis, specifically ANOVA.
